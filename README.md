# odin-recipes
The current project is my first "serious" project from Foundations Course of the Odin Project and which shows my knowledge in HTML.
I start with simple HTML and then it will be updated to more advanced level CSS and I hope JavaScript as well.
This project should demonstrate a simple recipe website and I don't know yet how it will look like. I hope to practice all my knowledge and hone my HTML skills.
